Hi, My name is Richard Tyrese Michio Uy.

4th year of Undergraduate Studies as a Computer Science Student.
My hobbies include playing computer games and eating different food from different cuisines. My favorite band is One Ok Rock. My favorite movie is the Pacific Rim. Darts is my primary sport. I love jogging.
